# Harvard CS50: Introduction to Computer Science

My solutions to Harvard University's CS50 Introduction to Computer Science course offered at edX. I used both CS50's [CS50 IDE](cs5.io) and my own text editor (Sublime Text) on Linux (Ubuntu) and macOS respectively, together with CS50's C library - [libcs50](https://github.com/cs50/libcs50). Library references can be found [here](https://reference.cs50.net)

## CS50 IDE vs Local Development Environment

The teaching staff at Harvard CS50 have taken time to preconfigure the CS50 IDE environment for us, so clang works a bit differently on the IDE compared to your local development environment. To compile the C files using clang execute the following command (make sure you have CS50's library for C installed):

```bash
clang -o [output file name] [file name].c -lcs50
```
